        Dear Sirs,
    <p class="body">
        I am writing to inform you that, due to financial difficulties, I will be 
        unable to pay my taxes this year. 
    </p>
    <p class="body">
        You see, my company has had reduced profits this year. In fact gross 
        revenues have now dropped below the GDP of <B>twelve</B> foreign 
        countries! Given this intolerable situation, I am sure you will 
        understand.
    </p>

        The 23rd Psalm (King James Version)
    </h2>
    <span>T</span>he LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
    <p> 
        He made me to lie down in green pastures: he led me beside the still 
        waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness 
        for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow 
        of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy 
        staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence 
        of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
        Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I 
        will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. 
    </p>

        Sincerely,
    </p>
    <BR>
